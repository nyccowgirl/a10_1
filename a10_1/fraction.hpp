 The Fraction class can be used to create objects that store a fraction, including numerator
 and denominator. The following functions are available:

 Fraction(int inNum, int inDenom);
  post: The calling object has been created and initialized so that the numerator is the
        inNum parameter (with default of 0), and the denominator is the inDenom
        parameter (with default of 1). If inDenom is 0, program is aborted.
 
 friend Fraction operator+(const Fraction &left, const Fraction &right);
  post: Returns the Fraction determined by adding the Fraction (or integer) of the
        parameter "left" with the Fraction (or integer) of the paramenter "right".
 
 friend Fraction operator-(const Fraction &left, const Fraction &right);
  post: Returns the Fraction determined by subtracting the Fraction (or integer) of
        the parameter "right" from the Fraction (or integer) of the parameter "left".
 
 friend Fraction operator*(const Fraction &left, const Fraction &right);
  post: Returns the Fraction determined by multiplying the Fraction (or integer) of
        the parameter "left" by the Fraction (or integer) of the parameter "right".
 
 friend Fraction operator/(const Fraction &left, const Fraction &right);
  post: Returns the Fraction determined by dividing the Fraction (or integer) of the
        parameter "left" by the Fraction (or integer) of the parameter "right".
 
 friend bool operator<(const Fraction &left, const Fraction &right);
  post: Returns true if the Fraction (or integer) of the parameter "left" is less
        than the Fraction (or integer) of the parameter "right". Otherwise, returns
        false.
 
 friend bool operator<=(const Fraction &left, const Fraction &right);
  post: Returns true if the Fraction (or integer) of the parameter "left" is less
        than or equal to the Fraction (or integer) of the parameter "right".

        integer) of the parameter "right".

  post: Returns the Fraction determined by subtracting the calling object with the Fraction
        (or integer) of the parameter "right".

  post: Returns the Fraction determined by multiplying the calling object by the Fraction
        (or integer) of the parameter "right".

  post: Returns the Fraction determined by dividing the calling object by the Fraction (or
        integer) of the parameter "right".

  post: Returns the Fraction determined by incrementing the calling object by 1
        (pre-increment operator).

  post: Returns the original calling object after incrementing it by 1 (post-increment
        operator).
